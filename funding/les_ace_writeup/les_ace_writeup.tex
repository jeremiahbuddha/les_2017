\begin{abstract}
\noindent

Near the beginning of Fall semester 2017, a total of \totalbooklets~ 
students will be handed a leaflet. Half the leaflets will have a
pro animal rights message (\textbf{test books}), half will be on a
non-animal related topic (\textbf{control books}). Each booklet will have a
sticker advertising a ``\$5 Starbucks or Amazon Gift Card for taking
brief survey" (\textbf{Part 1 Survey}). Students answering the survey will be 
asked about their current consumption of animal products (\textbf{base rate}) 
and given a gift card. Two months later, just before Thanksgiving 
break, these same students will receive an email, "Thanks for taking 
our previous survey! We have a few more questions, of course for 
another \$10 gift card!" (\textbf{Part 2 Survey}). Students will again
be asked about their current animal consumption. The data will
be examined to see if the pro-animal leaflets reduce the amount of
animal products consumed by the students (\textbf{post-test rate}), 
particularly to zero (the \textbf{``One Week Vegan"}).

\newthought{The Leafleting Effectiveness Survery (\les)} will attempt
to quantify the impact of pro-animal leafleting on the later 
consumption of animal products. In particular it will look for 
``one week vegans", or leaflet recipients who report no consumption of animal 
products in the post-test survey week. 
The relationship between leafleting and one week vegans is of real
concern for the organization leading \les, Vegan Outreach (VO). VO's
primary intervention on behalf of animals is to hand out pro-vegetarian,
anti-speciest literature to college students. Verifying the impact of this
intervention has become an organizational priority at the highest level.
VO also understands that this is a general concern of the broader
animal protection community, and has sought the support and advice of
partner organizations to carry out \les.

In particular, VO seeking the participation of Animal Charity 
Evaluators (ACE) as a partner on \les. This document outlines VO's formal
request for a grant from ACE's Animal Advocacy Research Fund. VO is 
looking to ACE to finance (1) the printing of \totalbooklets~ 
survey-advertising stickers (\$\stickercost) (2) the purchase of
\giftcardnum~ gift cards to distribute as incentives for taking the 
survery (\$\giftcardcost), and (3) the creation of a public website
to share the results (\$\websitecost).

\textsc{\les~ At A Glance}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Utilizes a pre- and post- survey to measure the 
            impact of leafleting on self-reported animal product 
            consumption.
    \item[] Pilot studies indicate that a brightly colored sticker 
            attached to leaflets advertising an incentivized survey
            (\$5 for P1, \$10 for P2, \$15 total per participant) can 
            generate a response rate of roughly 5\%.
    \item[] A total of \totalbooklets~ will be handed out (half test, 
            half-control), powering the study to detect a conversion of
            1\% or greater of the test population into a one week vegan.
    \item[] The leaflets will be handed out at \schoolnum~ schools in
            September 2017. Recipients have one week after the leaflets
            are handed out to complete the Part 1 survey. An email will
            be sent out to students who completed Part 1 in 
            mid-November, inviting them to fill out the Part 2 survey.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\begin{itemize}
\color{red}
    \item Talk here about previous leafleting studies
    \item Talk here about pilot studies.
\end{itemize}

\newthought{Vegan Outreach} has run a total of three pilot studies
in preparation for a full-scale LES. These pilots have focused primarily on 
crafting a study approach that results in a sufficiently high survey response rate to
make a fully powered LES tractable. The current study design (brightly colored stickers 
and \$15 incentive for 5\% response rate) is a direct result of these studies, summarized 
below.

\textsc{LES Pilot Studies}
\vskip 1em
\noindent
Pilot 1: Fall 2015 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] The first pilot study utilized a test group of 5000 and a control group of 1000. 
  \item[] Plain white stickers advertised a \$5 incentivized survery.
  \item[] Overall response rate (P1 \& P2) was 1.88\%. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent 
Pilot 2: Spring 2016 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] Two tests groups were used both with 100 participants.  
  \item[] Plain white stickers advertised \$10 (group 1) and \$20 (group 2) incentivized surveys.
  \item[] Response rates were 3\% and 2\% respectively. 
\end{itemize}
Pilot 3: Spring 2016 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] Test group with 600 participants.  
  \item[] Colored stickers advertised a \$5 incentivized survey. 
  \item[] An additional \$10 was offered to complete Part 2 of the survey.
  \item[] Response rate was 5\%.

The full-scale LES will use the strategy from Pilot 3. The key elements are
(1) colored stickers, (2) \$5 incentive for Part 1 survey, (3) \$10 for Part 2
survey. d
