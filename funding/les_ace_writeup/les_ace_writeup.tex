\noindent
\sitslong~ (\sitsshort) is a technology initiative that will empower NASA to 
document the most important milestones in robotic deep space exploration 
in a visceral and compelling way. It will equip spacecraft with the 
\textbf{\sitsshort~Imaging Instrument}, which deploys small imagers 
in the vicinity of the host spacecraft. These imagers, which are a 
fraction the size of a 1U CubeSat, autonomously collect footage of the 
spacecraft during important mission events. For instance, 
the imagers can be deployed to record HD video of the Europa 
spacecraft during a close approach to Europa 
(Fig. \ref{fig:sitsdepiction}). 

A design has been developed that integrates the \sitsshort~ concept 
into a 12U CubeSat for potential flight as a NASA Technology Demonstration 
Mission. This existing design can serve as the starting point for an 
NSTP-Sat adaptation, where the CubeSat bus can be eliminated and the 
rest of the hardware consolidated into a standalone payload instrument.

%\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\newthought{NASA's 2014 Strategic Plan explains} that its vision is to 
``reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind."
\sitsshort~ will give humankind a revolutionary experience by rolling back 
the curtain on our deep space operations and visually documenting our 
spacecraft as they explore the solar system. It does this through the 
\textbf{\sitsshort~ Imaging Instrument}, a spacecraft payload instrument 
that contains modern filmmaking equipment and that allows operators on 
the ground to design and capture high-definition video sequences of 
spacecraft operating in deep space.

\textsc{\sitsshort~ At A Glance}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Technology development effort to enable the collection of 
            cinematic footage of robotic spacecraft operating at-location
            in deep space. Ultimate goal is to develop a self-contained 
            instrument capable of adoption into typical deep space mission payloads.
    \item[]
    \item[] The \sitsshort~ Imaging Instrument} (referred to as the \textit{instrument}) 
            is a self-contained unit that can be mounted 
            as spacecraft payload. It protects and deploys 
            \sitsshort~ Imagers} (referred to as \textit{imagers}),
            which autonomously collect cinematic footage of the host spacecraft.
            The \textit{imagers} live-stream footage (4K video and stills) to the \textit{instrument}, 
            where it is stored until spacecraft downlink is available. \textit{Imagers} are 
            discarded after use, they do not re-dock.
    \item[]        
    \item[] Seed funding has been provided by JPL's Office of Formulation 
            (formerly the JPL Innovation Foundry). \sitsshort~ has graduated from JPL's A-Team 
            and TeamXc rapid design programs. The current point-design has the 
            \textit{instrument} merged into a 12U CubeSat that can fly as
            an independent NASA Technology Demonstration Mission. Moving to
            NSTP-Sat will allow the system to be redesigned and built in its
            nominal form as an instrument payload.

\sitslong~ has been sponsored the last 18 months by JPL's Office of 
Formulation (formerly the JPL Innovation Foundry). With their support, 
\sitsshort~ has received a NASA New Technology Report and provisional patent, passed through both 
A-Team and TeamXc study sessions, and emerged as a well developed concept 
with a point-engineering design.

\textsc{Why \sitsshort~ and why now?}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] Over the next decade, NASA spacecraft will journey to novel destinations and 
continue to push the boundaries of technological and scientific progress. During
these missions there will be epoch-making moments that deserve to be
documented for the benefit of all mankind. For too long these historic firsts
have been captured ad-hoc or not at all - the first landing on an asteroid (NEAR),
the first Mercury orbiter (Messenger), the first Pluto-Charon encounter 
(New Horizons). 
 
  \item[] Meanwhile on Earth, an eager public relies on artist drawings and computer renderings
to help them imagine our spacecraft as they travel to the furthest reaches of the solar
system. The demand for richer and more immersive experiences is evident in the 
exponential growth of social media, information sharing, and augmented reality. 
\sitsshort~ is a system that harnesses state-of-the-art storytelling technology to 
help people connect more deeply to NASAs mission of exploration and discovery.

\item[] Moreover, as operations in space become more and more complex, having an
asset such as \sitsshort~ onboard to monitor key spacecraft events (deployments, 
rendezvous, burns) brings a powerful engineering capability to missions. The 
flexibility \sitsshort~ brings with its autonomous, free-flying \textit{imagers} gives
an extra dimension of possibility to storytellers, engineers and scientists 
alike.

\section{Concept of Operations}\label{sec:conops}

%\begin{itemize}
%\color{red}
%    \item Description of the mission operations that would be required to enable the new science investigation.
%\end{itemize}

The \sitsshort~ system is designed to collect footage of its host spacecraft
operating at location. It does this by tasking an individual
\textit{imager} to fly a \texbf{media collection sortie}. These sorties are designed
in advance by analysts on the ground and uplinked to the \textit{instrument}. They identify
the time at which the \textit{imager} should be deployed and specify the trajectory and 
attitude profile that it needs to fly to collect the desired footage. There are 
three distinct phases involved in executing a sortie.

\begin{marginfigure}[-1.5 in]%
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sitscoop.png}
  \caption{\sitsshort~ \textit{imager} after deployment from the \textit{instrument} as it collects footage of the
  host spacecraft.}

\end{marginfigure}

\begin{fullwidth}
{  
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}\selectfont
\vskip 1.5em
\noindent
\textsc{Media Collection Sortie}
\vskip 1em
\noindent
Phase 1: Deployment 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] A sortie is initiated by the ejection of an \textit{imager} from its storage
  location inside the \textit{instrument}. The \textit{imager} will have been charged and tasked 
  with a trajectory prior to deployment. The ejection mechanism ensures that 
  \textit{imager} clears the immediate physical location of the host spacecraft, at which 
  point it brings the host spacecraft within
  its field of view and initiates a footage stream to 
  the \textit{instrument}. Once the feed has been registered, the \textit{imager} initiates its
  flight of the media collection trajectory.   
\end{itemize}
\noindent 
Phase 2: Collection
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] Once clear of the immediate vicinity of the host spacecraft, the \textit{imager}
  begins flight of the media collection trajectory.  This trajectory was designed by
  analysts on the ground to position and point the \textit{imager} to collect the desired 
  footage. The \textit{imager} dead-recons flight of the reference trajectory subject to
  an \textit{r-plus control law}.\footnote[][1.25 in]{\textit{R-plus} is designed to protect the host
  spacecraft at all costs, and stipulates that any maneuver performed by an \textit{imager}
  must have the effect of increasing the distance between the \textit{imager} and spacecraft.}
  An autonomous navigation system onboard the imager allows it to dynamically update 
  its pointing in the contingency that it departs the reference trajectory, ensuring that 
  the desired footage is collected. The \textit{imager} live streams footage directly to the
  \textit{instrument} where it is stored for downlink.  
\end{itemize}
\noindent 
Phase 3: Decommissioning
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] After completing flight of the collection trajectory, the \textit{imager} is prepped 
  for decommissioning. Instead of attempting a potentially hazardous docking back to the 
  \textit{instrument}, the \textit{imager} simply drifts off into space and the r-plus control law assures it
  permanently leaves the vicinity of the host spacecraft. The collected footage is processed
  by the \textit{instrument}, and chunked for eventual downlink to Earth. Due to the high volume of 
  data involved in current media formats, this downlink could be spread over months.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1.5em
}
\end{fullwidth}

Because the \textit{imagers} are single-use and then disposed, the number of 
\textit{imagers} housed in the \textit{instrument} correlates directly to how many independent
sequences can be shot over the lifetime of a mission. Therefore, the \textit{imagers} have
been optimized for short operational lives to minimize their size and
allow the \textit{instrument} to carry a greater number.

%\end{itemize}

The ultimate goal of this program is to design and build a spacecraft 
instrument that can be carried into deep space as payload on NASA's robotic 
exploration missions. However, an intermediate goal is currently being 
pursued to develop a technology demonstration version of the instrument for 
operation in Earth orbit. The design described below is the Earth-orbiting 
version, and was originally developed for proposal as a NASA Technology 
Demonstration Mission. As such, the standalone instrument has been merged into
into a 12U CubeSat that can fly independent of a host spacecraft.

\textsc{Design Overview}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Instrument} fits a 6U CubeSat form factor and contains five \textit{imagers}. Current design
            utilizes a 12U CubeSat for free-flying testbed, with the remaining 6U used for
            spacecraft bus systems.  
    \item[] Compatible with operations in LEO, GEO, and deep space. \textit{Imagers} maneuver in a 
            3m - 30m range from the host spacecraft, and have a nominal life span of 15 minutes.
    \item[] Use of modern cell phone components (processors, transmitters, batteries, etc.)
            allows for miniaturization of the free flying \textit{imagers}. Current size is 1/2U and further
            reduction is possible through reconfiguration of COTS hardware. Because the \textit{imagers}
            have a short operational life and are disposable, failure of these non-space hardened 
            components is an acceptable risk. 
\end{itemize}
}

The current \sitsshort~ design is the result of a JPL TeamXc rapid-design session. 
It identifies all key software and hardware components and verifies that the mission
concept is sound, but stops short of the detail needed to begin manufacture.
However, the extensive use of COTS and high-TRL technology mean that maturing the
design and progressing to hardware development can be done swiftly and safely. 
Table \ref{tab:dmat} lists the key system components and their maturity
levels.

\subsection{Collecting and Transmitting Footage}

Because the \textit{imagers} are discarded after a single use, emphasis has been placed on 
reducing both their physical size and cost so that more can be carried from 
mission start. Hardware is liberally sourced from the commercial cell 
phone market (Table \ref{tab:camstack}) which invests billions of dollars 
every year in just these initiatives (miniaturization and cost reduction). 

Each \textit{imager} is equipped with two cameras that independently stream
footage to the \textit{instrument}. Each camera has a dedicated Wifi chipset and
antenna to ensure a data-rate high enough to stream 4K video. On the receiving
end, the \textit{instrument} has four independent wifi receivers (chipset and antenna) which 
allows for the simultaneous operation of up to two \textit{imagers} (two dedicated 
channels for each \textit{imager}). The \textit{imagers} do not store any video; everything is 
streamed directly to the \textit{instrument} where it is logged in onboard storage and 
processed for downlink. As downlink becomes available, the \textit{instrument} queues 
up and sends data down through the main host spacecraft antenna.

% ---------------------------------------
\subsection{Autonomous operation}

JPL has an astrodynamic software toolkit called Monte\footnote{montepy.jpl.nasa.gov} 
that is used for high-accuracy trajectory design and navigation. The spacecraft 
trajectories produced by Monte are routinely used by science instrument operators to design 
their observation profiles. Monte can be configured to do an analogous task for
\sitsshort, which is to help operators design \textit{imager} sortie trajectories that 
capture dynamic cinematic shots of the spacecraft and its surrounding environment.
These trajectories will be created well in advance of the actual sortie, and 
uplinked for the \textit{imagers} to fly autonomously. 

After an \textit{imager} has been ejected, it begins flying the sortie only after it
has cleared a minimum-operational distance from the host spacecraft.\footnote{The current
design has this set at 3m, but it can be adjusted if the host spacecraft
has extended features (solar panels, magnetic booms) that need to be 
avoided.} At this point, the \textit{imager} uses its onboard IMU to dead-recon flight
of the reference trajectory. JPL's AutoNav flight software is used to adjust
the pointing of the \textit{imager} cameras in real time, to ensure the integrity of
the shot even if the \textit{imager} departs from its nominal flight plan.\footnote{AutoNav has 
flight heritage on several NASA missions, including Deep Impact and Stardust missions, where it was used with great 
success.} 

After the sortie is complete, the \textit{instrument} will autonomously process the collected
footage and segment it for downlink. Initially, only a low-resolution version of the
footage will be returned, allowing operators to prioritize in what order the 
full-resolution segments will be returned.

%\end{itemize}

In order for \sitsshort~ to be ready for flight on-board NSTP-Sat in 2021, an official,
funded \sitslong~ project needs to be established in FY18. The first order of business 
is to alter the system design to fit the NSTP-Sat paradigm. The current design is 
a merged version of the \sitsshort~ concept into a 12U CubeSat (6U for \sitsshort~ 
and 6U for the CubeSat bus) appropriate for flight as a standalone NASA Technology 
Demonstration Mission. Adapted to NSTP-Sat, \sitsshort~ would drop off the 6U bus and 
assume its proper form as a true payload instrument. During this redesign, the 
\textit{instrument} can be custom-fitted to NSTP-Sat's size, weight, and power 
requirements.\footnote{The overall size and weight of the resulting \textit{instrument} can
be adjusted by adding or removing \textit{imagers} from its manifest.}

    \item[\textbf{ATP + 31 months}] Start Payload Integration.
\end{itemize}
}
\end{fullwidth}

Once \sitsshort~~ has been redesigned, an accelerated hardware development program
needs to be initiated. Because so much of the system is built on high-TRL or COTS 
technology, rapid fabrication of the \textit{instrument} and \textit{imagers} is feasible in 
a very short timeframe. During the prototyping phase, manufacturers will be 
engaged to help reconfigure their products to further miniaturize the \textit{imager} 
design, which will in turn reduce the size of the overall instrument package.
Additionally, the non-space hardened components will be vacuum and radiation tested 
and any which show signs of failing before the planned \textit{imager} lifetime of 15 minutes
can be replaced. Lessons learned from the prototype will be wrapped into the final design
and fabrication of a flight-ready instrument.
